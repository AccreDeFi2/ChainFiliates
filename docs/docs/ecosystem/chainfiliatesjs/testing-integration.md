# Testing your Integration

To test your integration of ChainFiliatesJS, be sure to configure ChainFiliates to use Staging and then use one of the Test Campaigns over at the [ChainFiliates Staging Environment](https://app.staging.chainfiliates.so/)!

```javascript
const chainfiliates = ChainFiliates({ apiUrl: "https://app.staging.chainfiliates.so/api" });

```

[A Campaign has already been configured](https://app.staging.chainfiliates.so/campaign/arweave/ida4Pebl2uULdI\_rN8waEw65mVH9uIFTY1JyeZt1PBM) with a Destination URL of [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)&#x20;

This means that when this Invite Link is used, a redirect to [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) will take place.

To get started on this Staging Campaign, connect a wallet and Start a Partnership!

All Partnerships submitted to this Staging Environment are managed on the [Ceramic Testnet](https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/available/).
