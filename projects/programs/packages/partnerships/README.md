# `@chainfiliates/partnerships`

ChainFiliates Partnerships is a package that simplifies partnership creation on behalf of end-users against a given Campaign.

Any authenticated DID (user) can fetch their related partnerships data and invite links through authentication with ChainFiliates's API.

## Methods

- **`addPartnership`**  
  Create a partnership against any Campaign on behalf of the most suitable Wallet/DID Authentication loaded in memory.
- **`createPartnership`**  
  Create a partnership against any Campaign on behalf of a specific Wallet/DID Authentication managed inside of [`@chainfiliates/auth`](packages/auth).
- **`loadRelatedPartnerships`**  
  Load all partnerships data indexed against the authenticated user.
